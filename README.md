Fully documented pong-implementation using [Rygal](http://rygal.org)
====================================================================

This project serves as a demonstration of multiple features of the game engine
called Rygal. It's not meant to be a demonstration of all technical capabilities
of the engine, it's made to provide newcomers to Rygal with a code example, thus
the whole source code is documented to explain what specific lines are used for.

Prerequisites
-------------

This repository contains the source code, assets and a project file for
FlashDevelop. If you use a different IDE, you have to port it on your own.

Nevertheless, you **will** need Rygal installed, a simple installation tutorial
can be found on [Rygal's wiki](https://github.com/rynti/Rygal/wiki/Setup-guide).
